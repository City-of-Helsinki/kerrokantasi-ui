**Goal**
- Diagnose why the test is failing and deliver a corrected version that passes locally and in CI—without touching the application’s source code.

**Tools**
- The Playwright CLI to run tests and inspect stack traces.
  Example: 'npx playwright test e2e/tests/page-spec/hearing-detail.spec.js --grep "As a user I want to verify hearing metadata visibility"'
- Playwright MCP and application running at http://localhost:8086 for live debugging.

**Hard rules**
- Run only tools that does not require any interactive actions
- Do NOT modify application code
- Do not run tests with `--debug` flag

**Deliverables**
- Brief analysis of the failure (summarise the CLI error and root cause).
- Patch: corrected test files and selectors update to the code.
