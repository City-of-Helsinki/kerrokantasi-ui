**Goal**  
Generate a clean, human-readable catalog of every **user-facing** route in this React application.

- Output the completed catalog to Markdown file in the e2e/plan/routes directory.

---

## 1 · Scope  

* **Include**:  
  • Pages reachable from the public navigation flow (menu links, buttons, redirects).  
  • Dynamic routes expressed with placeholders (e.g. `/hearing/:hearingSlug`).  
  • Feature-flagged or lazy-loaded pages that a real user can reach.  

* **Exclude**:  
  • API endpoints, asset files, internal dev tools, test pages, 404s, or admin-only routes.

## 2 · How to discover the routes  

1. **Launch the app** at `http://localhost:8086`.  
2. Parse the SPA router configuration (e.g. React Router) **or** crawl the UI by simulating clicks on every in-app link up to a reasonable depth.  
3. Capture distinct pathname patterns; normalise dynamic segments to `:paramName`.  
4. De-dupe paths that map to the same screen.  
5. For each path, record a **concise end-user description** (max one line).  
6. Sort the list logically (root → primary → detail → wildcard).
