**Goal**

Given an app route, **analyse the related code**, extract every piece of end-user functionality, and generate a **comprehensive Playwright test-plan**.  
The deliverable is one or more markdown documents that conform to the *Playwright Test-Plan Documentation Standards* below.

---
This prompt instructs you to analyze the provided view code and produce a detailed summary along with an end-to-end test plan using Playwright. The output should clearly outline the page’s full functionality and include well-structured test cases for scenarios.

**Hard rules**

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| 1 | **Output only markdown files** in `e2e/plan/stories/`; one file per functional area. |
| 2 | Use **kebab-case** filenames ending with `-tests.md` (e.g. `user-profile-tests.md`). |
| 3 | If the file already exists, **merge / append** new content in place—never overwrite blindly. |
| 4 | Preserve the **Page Analysis** section and every **Test Case** block from previous revisions. |
| 5 | Start each file with a **Table of Contents** (markdown links). |
| 6 | Number all test steps **sequentially**. |
| 7 | Every file ends with: **Test Coverage**, **Prerequisites**, and **Revision History** sections. |
| 8 | Do **not** emit narrative, logs, or code outside the markdown files. |
