######################## Common settings ##############################

# Address and port the server will listen to. The ones below are defaults
# useful for development. On a more formal occasion you will likely to want
# change these.
#listen_address="localhost"
#listen_port="8086"

# Base URL of the API, without version or trailing slash (/)
kerrokantasi_api_base="https://api.hel.fi/kerrokantasi-test"

# JWT aud(ience)-field that we will request from the SSO. Each API instance
# will require a specific audience. This means that this value will need
# to match what the API specified in kerrokantasi_api_base wants.
kerrokantasi_api_jwt_audience="replace-me-with-real-target-app-for-authentication-to-work"

# Image to use for the hero of the front page
hero_image_url="http://materialbank.myhelsinki.fi/detail/1192/download/7"

# Tunnistamo (Helsinki SSO) URL to use. Kerrokantasi currently uses some
# authentication calls that are specific to tunnistamo, although
# some other systems might be flexible enough to support them as well.
tunnistamo_url="https://api.hel.fi/sso"

# Our own client identifier in the SSO system, SSO uses this to decide
# which authentication methods are available and which (API) audiences are allowed
auth_client_id="replace-me-with-real-auth-id-for-authentication-to-work"

# Shared secret for proving to the SSO we really are the client specified
# in auth_client_id
auth_shared_secret="replace-me-with-real-auth-secret-for-authentication-to-work"

# Specifies the canonical URL for this service. Kerrokantasi-UI currently
# uses this for generating the requested callback address from SSO. This
# will need to match whatever you enter in the browser address bar to reach
# the UI, and the SSO must also be configured to accept this.
# Default is, again, for development.
public_url="http://localhost:8086"

# ExpressJS uses this secret for purposes. We are not sure if kerrokantasi-ui
# actually uses that functionality. It is still required.
expressjs_session_secret="dev-secret-do-not-use-in-production"

#################### City specific configuration ######################

# For whitelabel styles use "whitelabel".
# For city assets installed to node_modules use the name of the package
# for instance "kerrokantasi-ui-turku".
