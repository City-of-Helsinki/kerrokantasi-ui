# Voice Your Opinion - accessibility statement  
This accessibility statement applies to the Voice Your Opinion digital service (https://kerrokantasi.hel.fi/?locale=en) run by the City of Helsinki. This statement explains the digital service’s accessibility and how to submit accessibility-related feedback.  


## How accessible is this digital service?  
Finland’s Act on the Provision of Digital Services states that public digital services must be accessible. In other words, everyone should have an equal opportunity to use digital services.   

The digital service is for the most part complaint with all of the statutorily mandated accessibility requirements (WCAG criteria 2.1, A and AA standards). The digital service has some accessibility shortcomings which are described in more detail below.

## Accessibility assessment
