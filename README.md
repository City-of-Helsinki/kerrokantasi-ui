Kerrokantasi UI is the user interface powering kerrokantasi.hel.fi service. It
is a full featured interface for both answering and creating questionnaires as
supported by Kerrokantasi API.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Node v8 LTS
* Yarn
* Docker

### Configuration

`config_dev.toml` is used for configuration when NODE_ENV != "production". It
is in TOML-format, which for our purposes is `Key=Value` format.

When NODE_ENV=="production", only environment variables are used for
configuration. This is done because we've had several painful accidents
with leftover configuration files. The environment variables are named
identically to the ones used in config_dev.toml. Do note that the variables
are case insensitive, ie. `KeRRokanTasi_aPi_bASe` is a valid name. Go wild!

In the repository root there is `config_dev.toml.example` which contains
every setting and comments explaining their use. If you only want to give
kerrokantasi-ui a test, all configuration you need to do is:
`cp config_dev.toml.example config_dev.toml`. That will give you a partially
working configuration for browsing test questionnaires in our test API.

### Running development server

```
yarn build
yarn start
```
No separate build step is required to start the development server.
It is somewhat unstable, but provides hot reloading:
```
yarn run dev
```

The server will output the URL for accessing kerrokantasi-ui.

### Running in production

You can use your favorite process manager to run `yarn build` and `yarn start`.
Node-specific managers can also directly run `compile(/index.js)` & `server(/index.js)`.

### Other commands

* `yarn run fetch-plugins`: fetch optional plugins (see below)
* `yarn run test`: run tests
* `yarn test -- -u` update tests

### Running service in Docker

#### How to build a docker image
```bash
docker build . -t kerrokantasi-ui
```

#### How to run the docker image
```bash
docker run -p 8086:8086 kerrokantasi-ui
```

### Plugins

Questionnaires can make use of plugins. As of yet, their use case
has been to provide map based questionnaries. Examples include having
citizens indicate places for amenities and polling the public for
locations of city bike stations.

A default set of plugins can be installed using `yarn run fetch-plugins`.
The plugins are installed in `assets/plugins`. By default, kerrokantasi-ui
expects to find them in `assets/plugins` URL prefix. The development server
serves that path, but you can also use a web server of your choice for this.
For server insllations, the plugin fetcher supports downloading the plugins
to a directory specified on the command line (`yarn run fetch-plugins
/srv/my-kerrokantasi-plugins`).

It is also possible to change the paths that kerrokantasi-ui will search for
specific plugins. See `src/shared_config.json`, which is the configuration
source for both the plugin fetcher script and the UI itself. After
changing the paths therein, you can run the plugin fetcher and it will
place the plugins to those directories. Note that specifying path on the
command line overrides the path specified in shared_config.json.

## Writing of CSS

**Important:**
Kerrokantasi default UI styles are meant to be generic styles (a.k.a whitelabel
styles). This means that no city specific variables or colors should be used
in the `assets/sass/` folder. This project supports theming and if there's
a need to style components differently to match a certain city's branding,
theme styles will be used to override any default styles.

The styles are based on Bootstrap version 3 (Sass).

## Using the whitelabel theme assets

To have a non city specific theme, change the `city_config` config value to `whitelabel`

## Installing city specific assets

Currently the process of using the theme is not super developer friendly as it does
not support the use of `yarn link`. This means that to do development on the project
it will have to be installed in the kerrokantasi-ui project and then edited within
the kerrokantasi-ui `node_modules/<theme_assets>` folder. If someone can find
a solution to this, please fix.

**Development steps:**
1. Place the theme assets folder next to the `kerrokantasi-ui` folder
    * The structure should look like this:
      ```
      /
        /kerrokantasi-ui
        /<theme-assets-folder>
      ```
2. In the `kerrokantasi-ui` project run `yarn add ../<theme-assets-folder>`
3. Edit files in `kerrokantasi-ui/node_modules/<theme-assets-folder>` for changes to be reflected
4. Set the `city_config` config to `<theme-assets-folder>`

**Production installation:**
1. Add the project to the local `kerrokantasi-ui` project either by installing it
   the same way as in the dev environment, or from GitHub or if the package is published
   to npm, then install it from there.
2. Set the `city_config` config to `<theme-assets-folder>`

## Creating city specific assets

The assets of a city currently consists of the following things:
1. Styling
2. Favicons
3. Images
4. Translation strings
5. Service URLs and external URLs

An example of how a theme assets project could look like, either check out the `cities/helsinki`
folder in this project, or have a look already created theme assets such as:

https://github.com/City-of-Turku/kerrokantasi-ui-turku

### Styles
How to apply your theme CSS:

Create a file `assets/app.scss` and apply style imports accordingly:
```
// This needs to be imported before kerrokantasi variables
@import "my-custom-variables.scss";

// Import the required kerrokantasi styles
@import "~kerrokantasi-ui/assets/sass/kerrokantasi/variables.scss";
@import "~kerrokantasi-ui/assets/sass/kerrokantasi/bootstrap.scss";
@import "~kerrokantasi-ui/assets/sass/kerrokantasi/kerrokantasi.scss";

// These are imported after the kerrokantasi styles to apply overrides
@import "my-custom-styles-and-overrides.scss";
```

### Aliases
The following aliases are available to use in SCSS and JS files:
* `kerrokantasi-ui`: Points to the root of this project
* `kerrokantasi-ui-modules`: Points to the node_modules of this project
* `@city-config`: Points to the root of the city specific assets
* `@city-assets`: Points to the assets folder in the city specific assets
* `@city-i18n`: Point to the i18n folder in the city specific assets
* `@@city-images`: Point to the image folder in the city specific assets

### Naming conventions
The following naming conventions needs to be used in order to city assets to
work.

* `/assets/app.scss`: The base style file that is imported
* `/i18n/[fi, sv, en].json`: Language files. If no string changes are to be made, only include `{}` in the files
* `/i18n/localization.json`: Other configuration related to localization. Currently holds map default position
* `/i18n/service-info/content.[fi, sv, en].md`: Service info page texts, if no file found service will display
information that content was not found.
* `/assets/images/logo[fi, sv]-black.svg`: Black/Dark site logo
* `/assets/images/logo[fi, sv]-white.svg`: White/Light site logo
* `/assets/urls.json`: Configure where links point to, also holds path to analytics script. If analytics path is
false analytics is disabled.

#### Favicons:
The following favicons are recommended, but not mandatory to include.

* `/assets/favicon/favicon.ico`
* `/assets/favicon/favicon-32x32.png`
* `/assets/favicon/favicon-16x16.png`
* `/assets/favicon/manifest.json`
* `/assets/favicon/safari-pinned-tab.svg`
* `/assets/favicon/browserconfig.xml`

If no favicon is provided the UI will use the default kerrokantasi favicon.
